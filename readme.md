# CodeCast

"Experience the craft of code."

People learn programming best when they are able to manipulate and run code themselves. There's currently no easy way for coding students to do this with the code they see during live lectures or video recordings.

CodeCast is an interactive screencasting application for programming instructors and students.
Teachers can initiate coding sessions to livestream a working REPL, and users can play back any previous session at their convenience. At any point during a live or recorded lecture, students can fork the displayed text, allowing them to modify, run, and save their own variations on the instructor's code, without interfering with the main code.

Features:

* Functional JavaScript interpreter
* Real-time updating and broadcasting of code editor, outputted results, and comments
* Instructors can selectively allow students to edit the broadcasted code editor
* Live forking: as an instructor streams code, the user can extract and manipulate the displayed code
* Replay forking: the user can extract displayed code from any point in the video
* Audio playback for recorded lectures
* Dashboards list all available sessions, recordings, and saved forks
* Google and Github Authentication
