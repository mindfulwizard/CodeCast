CodeCast is a screencasting tool for programming instructors and students. Teachers can initiate coding sessions to livestream a working REPL, and users can play back any previous session at their convenience. At any point during a live or recorded lecture, students can fork the displayed text, allowing them to tweak and run their own variations on the instructor's code.
