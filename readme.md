# CodeCast

"Experience the craft of code."

CodeCast is a screencasting tool for programming instructors and students. Teachers can initiate coding sessions to livestream a working REPL, and users can play back any previous session at their convenience. At any point during a live or recorded lecture, students can fork the displayed text, allowing them to modify, run, and save their own variations on the instructor's code.

Features:

*Audio playback for recorded lectures
*Full syntax highlighting
*Users can submit comments seen by all lecture attendees
*Login with Google, Twitter, or Github
*Student dashboard lists all available sessions and recordings
*Instructor dashboard enables creation of sessions and manages student permissions
