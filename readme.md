# CodeCast

"Allowing everyone to experience the craft of code."

CodeCast is a screencasting tool for programming instructors and students. Teachers can initiate coding sessions to livestream a working REPL, and users can play back any previous session at their convenience. At any point during a live or recorded lecture, students can fork the displayed text, allowing them to tweak and run their own variations on the instructor's code.

Features:
 * Optional audio streaming
 * Instructors can selectively enable a student to edit the code being broadcast
 * Full syntax highlighting
 * Users can submit comments seen by all lecture attendees
 * Login with Google, Twitter, or Github
 * Student dashboard lists all available sessions and recordings
 * Instructor dashboard manages student permissions
